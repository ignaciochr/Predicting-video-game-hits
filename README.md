Predicting VG hits (>1 million sales) with LR, RFC
===============================================

**By: Ignacio Chavarria ([@ignacio_chr][2])**

In this notebook I analyze VG sales, use LR / RFC models to predict whether a game will sell over 1 million units (a "hit" game), and identify which features are most correlated to VG hits.

Test accuracy: 86.59%

Notebook sections:

 1. Data exploration and analysis
 2. Prediction model
 3. Which 2016 games can still become hits?
